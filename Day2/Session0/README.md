# Mini Project: 

We'll be diving into Arduino basics today, but first let's acquaint ourselves with what an Arduino is and what kinds of things people do with them through play!


## The "Hello World" of Arduinos: The LED Circuit

Using the Simulated Arduino on the Wokwi website (https://wokwi.com/projects/new/arduino-uno), follow the Adafruit tutorial and use the point-and-click interface to wire up an LED.  Don't worry about the code itself yet; right now, it's just about getting familiarized with the idea of connecting an Arduino.
